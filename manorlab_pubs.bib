	abstract = {Mitochondria play a crucial role in the regulation of cellular metabolism and signalling. Mitochondrial activity is modulated by the processes of mitochondrial fission and fusion, which are required to properly balance respiratory and metabolic functions, transfer material between mitochondria, and remove damaged or defective mitochondria. Mitochondrial fission occurs at sites of contact between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, and is dependent on the formation of mitochondria- and ER-associated actin filaments that drive the recruitment and activation of the fission GTPase DRP1. On the other hand, the role of mitochondria- and ER-associated actin filaments in mitochondrial fusion remains unknown. Here we show that preventing the formation of actin filaments on either mitochondria or the ER using organelle-targeted Disassembly-promoting, encodable Actin tools (DeActs) blocks both mitochondrial fission and fusion. We show that fusion but not fission is dependent on Arp2/3, and both fission and fusion are dependent on INF2 formin-dependent actin polymerization. Together, our work introduces a novel method for perturbing organelle-associated actin filaments, and demonstrates a previously unknown role for mitochondria- and ER-associated actin in mitochondrial fusion.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract={In the senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mouse model, oxidative stress leads to premature senescence and age-related hearing impairment (ARHI). CMS121 inhibits oxytosis/ferroptosis by targeting fatty acid synthase. The aim of our study was to determine whether CMS121 is protective against ARHI in SAMP8 mice. Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were used to assess baseline hearing in sixteen 4-week-old female SAMP8 mice, which were divided into two cohorts. The control group was fed a vehicle diet, while the experimental group was fed a diet containing CMS121. ABRs were measured until 13 weeks of age. Cochlear immunohistochemistry was performed to analyze the number of paired ribbon-receptor synapses per inner hair cell (IHC). Descriptive statistics are provided with mean{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}SEM. Two-sample t-tests were performed to compare hearing thresholds and paired synapse count across the two groups, with alpha{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.05. Baseline hearing thresholds in the control group were statistically similar to those of the CMS121 group. At 13 weeks of age, the control group had significantly worse hearing thresholds at 12 kHz (56.5 vs. 39.8, p{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.044) and 16 kHz (64.8 vs. 43.8, p{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.040) compared to the CMS121 group. Immunohistochemistry showed a significantly lower synapse count per IHC in the control group (15.7) compared to the CMS121 group (18.4), p{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.014. Our study shows a significant reduction in ABR threshold shifts and increased preservation of IHC ribbon synapses in the mid-range frequencies among mice treated with CMS121 compared to untreated mice.},

  abstract = {Cells respond to mitochondrial poisons with rapid activation of the adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK), causing acute metabolic changes through phosphorylation and prolonged adaptation of metabolism through transcriptional effects. Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is a major effector of AMPK that increases expression of lysosome genes in response to energetic stress, but how AMPK activates TFEB remains unresolved. We demonstrate that AMPK directly phosphorylates five conserved serine residues in folliculin-interacting protein 1 (FNIP1), suppressing the function of the folliculin (FLCN)–FNIP1 complex. FNIP1 phosphorylation is required for AMPK to induce nuclear translocation of TFEB and TFEB-dependent increases of peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α) and estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα) messenger RNAs. Thus, mitochondrial damage triggers AMPK-FNIP1–dependent nuclear translocation of TFEB, inducing sequential waves of lysosomal and mitochondrial biogenesis. The kinase AMPK is a key sensor that helps to control energy homeostasis. Malik et al. reveal the mechanism by which AMPK controls the transcription factor TFEB to increase gene transcription and to support mitochondrial and lysosomal biogenesis. AMPK appears to act by direct phosphorylation of folliculin-interacting protein 1 (FNIP1). FNIP is part of a complex that acts as a GTP-activating protein for the GTPases RagC and RagD, which regulate the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 protein kinase signaling complex on the lysosomal surface. This results in release of TFEB from the lysosome, allowing it to act at the nucleus. —LBR The energy-sensing protein kinase AMPK also regulates organelle biogenesis.}

  ABSTRACT={Morphology and function of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and corresponding working memory performance, are affected early in the aging process, but nearly half of aged individuals are spared of working memory deficits. Translationally relevant model systems are critical for determining the neurobiological drivers of this variability. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is advantageous as a model for these investigations because, as a non-human primate, marmosets have a clearly defined dlPFC that enables measurement of prefrontal-dependent cognitive functions, and their short (∼10 year) lifespan facilitates longitudinal studies of aging. Previously, we characterized working memory capacity in a cohort of marmosets that collectively covered the lifespan, and found age-related working memory impairment. We also found a remarkable degree of heterogeneity in performance, similar to that found in humans. Here, we tested the hypothesis that changes to synaptic ultrastructure that affect synaptic efficacy stratify marmosets that age with cognitive impairment from those that age without cognitive impairment. We utilized electron microscopy to visualize synapses in the marmoset dlPFC and measured the sizes of boutons, presynaptic mitochondria, and synapses. We found that coordinated scaling of the sizes of synapses and mitochondria with their associated boutons is essential for intact working memory performance in aged marmosets. Further, lack of synaptic scaling, due to a remarkable failure of synaptic mitochondria to scale with presynaptic boutons, selectively underlies age-related working memory impairment. We posit that this decoupling results in mismatched energy supply and demand, leading to impaired synaptic transmission. We also found that aged marmosets have fewer synapses in dlPFC than young, though the severity of synapse loss did not predict whether aging occurred with or without cognitive impairment. This work identifies a novel mechanism of synapse dysfunction that stratifies marmosets that age with cognitive impairment from those that age without cognitive impairment. The process by which synaptic scaling is regulated is yet unknown and warrants future investigation.}

	abstract = {Myelin is essential for rapid nerve signaling and is increasingly found to play important roles in learning and in diverse diseases of the CNS. Morphological parameters of myelin such as sheath length and thickness are regulated by neuronal activity and can precisely tune conduction velocity, but the mechanisms controlling sheath morphology are poorly understood. Local calcium signaling has been observed in nascent myelin sheaths and can be modulated by neuronal activity. However, the role of calcium signaling in sheath formation and remodeling is unknown. Here, we used genetic tools to attenuate oligodendrocyte calcium signaling during active myelination in the developing mouse CNS. Surprisingly, we found that genetic calcium attenuation did not grossly affect the number of myelinated axons or myelin thickness. Instead, calcium attenuation caused striking myelination defects resulting in shorter, dysmorphic sheaths. Mechanistically, calcium attenuation reduced actin filaments in oligodendrocytes, and an intact actin cytoskeleton was necessary and sufficient to achieve accurate myelin morphology. Together, our work reveals a novel cellular mechanism required for accurate CNS myelin formation and provides mechanistic insight into how oligodendrocytes may respond to neuronal activity to sculpt myelin sheaths throughout the nervous system.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Despite evidence from our lab and others about its polygenic nature, little is known about the specific genes, cell types and pathways involved in ARHL, impeding the development of therapeutic interventions. In this manuscript, we describe, for the first time, the complete cell-type specific transcriptome of the aging mouse cochlea using snRNA-seq in an outbred mouse model in relation to auditory threshold variation. Cochlear cell types were identified using unsupervised clustering and annotated via a three-tiered approach - first by linking to expression of known marker genes, then using the NS-Forest algorithm to select minimum cluster-specific marker genes and reduce dimensional feature space for statistical comparison of our clusters with existing publicly-available data sets on the gEAR website (https://umgear.org/), and finally, by validating and refining the annotations using Multiplexed Error Robust Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (MERFISH) and the cluster-specific marker genes as probes. We report on 60 unique cell-types expanding the number of defined cochlear cell types by more than two times. Importantly, we show significant specific cell type increases and decreases associated with loss of hearing acuity implicating specific subsets of hair cell subtypes, ganglion cell subtypes, and cell subtypes withing the stria vascularis in this model of ARHL.

  abstract = { Rationale: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)–induced endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction contributes to OSA-related cardiovascular sequelae. The mechanistic basis of endothelial impairment by OSA is unclear. Objectives: The goals of this study were to identify the mechanism of OSA-induced EC dysfunction and explore the potential therapies for OSA-accelerated cardiovascular disease. Methods: The experimental methods include data mining, bioinformatics, EC functional analyses, OSA mouse models, and assessment of OSA human subjects. Measurements and Main Results: Using mined microRNA sequencing data, we found that microRNA 210 (miR-210) conferred the greatest induction by intermittent hypoxia in ECs. Consistently, the serum concentration of miR-210 was higher in individuals with OSA from two independent cohorts. Importantly, miR-210 concentration was positively correlated with the apnea–hypopnea index. RNA sequencing data collected from ECs transfected with miR-210 or treated with OSA serum showed a set of genes commonly altered by miR-210 and OSA serum, which are largely involved in mitochondrion-related pathways. ECs transfected with miR-210 or treated with OSA serum showed reduced V˙o2 rate, mitochondrial membrane potential, and DNA abundance. Mechanistically, intermittent hypoxia-induced SREBP2 (sterol regulatory element–binding protein 2) bound to the promoter region of miR-210, which in turn inhibited the iron–sulfur cluster assembly enzyme and led to mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, the SREBP2 inhibitor betulin alleviated intermittent hypoxia–increased systolic blood pressure in the OSA mouse model. Conclusions: These results identify an axis involving SREBP2, miR-210, and mitochondrial dysfunction, representing a new mechanistic link between OSA and EC dysfunction that may have important implications for treating and preventing OSA-related cardiovascular sequelae. }

These aggregates form inside endolysosomes -called endoggresomes-, within swellings that line up the length of axons of degenerating neurons. The pathways impaired by endoggresomes that result in failed axonal and consequently neuronal health, remain undefined. Here, we dissect the local subcellular impairments that occur within individual mutant PrP endoggresome swelling sites in axons. Quantitative high-resolution light and electron microscopy revealed the selective impairment of the acetylated vs tyrosinated microtubule cytoskeleton, while micro-domain image analysis of live organelle dynamics within swelling sites revealed deficits uniquely to the MT-based active transport system that translocates mitochondria and endosomes toward the synapse. Cytoskeletal and defective transport results in the retention of mitochondria, endosomes, and molecular motors at swelling sites, enhancing mitochondria-Rab7 late endosome contacts that induce mitochondrial fission via the activity of Rab7, and render mitochondria dysfunctional. Our findings point to mutant Pr Pendoggresome swelling sites as selective hubs of cytoskeletal deficits and organelle retention that drive the remodeling of organelles along axons.

We show that astrocytes, through production of glypican 5 (GPC5), are required for maturation and refinement of synapses in the developing mouse cortex. In the absence of astrocyte GPC5 thalamocortical synapses in the visual cortex show structural immaturity during the critical period, including smaller presynaptic terminals, decreased postsynaptic density area, and presence of more postsynaptic partners at multisynaptic connections. This structural immaturity is accompanied by a delay in developmental incorporation of GLUA2-containing calcium impermeable AMPARs at intracortical synapses. The functional impact of this is that mice lacking astrocyte GPC5 exhibit increased levels of ocular dominance plasticity in adulthood. This shows astrocyte GPC5 is necessary for maturation and stabilization of synaptic connections in typical development, with implications for understanding disorders with altered synaptic function, including Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease, where GPC5 levels are altered.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {During early ischemic brain injury, glutamate receptor hyperactivation mediates neuronal death via osmotic cell swelling. Here we show that ischemia and excess NMDA receptor activation cause actin to rapidly and extensively reorganize within the somatodendritic compartment. Normally, F-actin is concentrated within dendritic spines. However, <5 min after bath-applied NMDA, F-actin depolymerizes within spines and polymerizes into stable filaments within the dendrite shaft and soma. A similar actinification occurs after experimental ischemia in culture, and photothrombotic stroke in mouse. Following transient NMDA incubation, actinification spontaneously reverses. Na+, Cl−, water, and Ca2+ influx, and spine F-actin depolymerization are all necessary, but not individually sufficient, for actinification, but combined they induce activation of the F-actin polymerization factor inverted formin-2 (INF2). Silencing of INF2 renders neurons vulnerable to cell death and INF2 overexpression is protective. Ischemia-induced dendritic actin reorganization is therefore an intrinsic pro-survival response that protects neurons from death induced by cell edema.},

  ABSTRACT={Nuclear positioning is important for the functionality of many cell types and is mediated by interactions of cytoskeletal elements and nucleoskeleton proteins. Nesprin proteins, part of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, have been shown to participate in nuclear positioning in multiple cell types. Outer hair cells (OHCs) in the inner ear are specialized sensory epithelial cells that utilize somatic electromotility to amplify auditory signals in the cochlea. Recently, Nesprin-4 (encoded by Syne4) was shown to play a crucial role in nuclear positioning in OHCs. Syne4 deficiency in humans and mice leads to mislocalization of the OHC nuclei and cell death resulting in deafness. However, it is unknown how Nesprin-4 mediates the position of the nucleus, and which other molecular components are involved in this process. Here, we show that the interaction of Nesprin-4 and the microtubule motor kinesin-1 is mediated by a conserved 4 amino-acid motif. Using in vivo AAV gene delivery, we show that this interaction is critical for nuclear positioning and hearing in mice. Nuclear mislocalization and cell death of OHCs coincide with the onset of hearing and electromotility and are solely restricted to outer, but not inner, hair cells. Likewise, the C. elegans functional homolog of Nesprin-4, UNC-83, uses a similar motif to mediate interactions between migrating nuclei and kinesin-1. Overall, our results suggest that OHCs require unique cellular machinery for proper nuclear positioning at the onset of electromotility. This machinery relies on the interaction between Nesprin-4 and kinesin-1 motors supporting a microtubule cargo model for nuclear positioning.}

  abstract = {The transduction of acoustic information by hair cells depends upon mechanosensitive stereociliary bundles that project from their apical surface. Mutations or absence of the stereociliary protein EPS8 cause deafness in humans and mice, respectively. Eps8 knockout mice (Eps8?/?) have hair cells with immature stereocilia and fail to become sensory receptors. Here, we show that exogenous delivery of Eps8 using Anc80L65 in P1?P2 Eps8?/? mice in vivo rescued the hair bundle structure of apical-coil hair cells. Rescued hair bundles correctly localize EPS8, WHIRLIN, MYO15, and BAIAP2L2, and generate normal mechanoelectrical transducer currents. Inner hair cells with normal-looking stereocilia re-expressed adult-like basolateral ion channels (BK and KCNQ4) and have normal exocytosis. The number of hair cells undergoing full recovery was not sufficient to rescue hearing in Eps8?/? mice. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-transduction of P3 apical-coil and P1?P2 basal-coil hair cells does not rescue hair cells, nor does Anc80L65-Eps8 delivery in adult Eps8?/? mice. We propose that AAV-induced gene-base therapy is an efficient strategy to recover the complex hair-cell defects in Eps8?/? mice. However, this therapeutic approach may need to be performed in utero since, at postnatal ages, Eps8?/? hair cells appear to have matured or accumulated damage beyond the point of repair.},

  abstract = {Summary
  Hearing depends on precise synaptic transmission between cochlear inner hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons through afferent ribbon synapses. Neuroligins (Nlgns) facilitate synapse maturation in the brain, but they have gone unstudied in the cochlea. We report Nlgn3 and Nlgn1 knockout (KO) cochleae have fewer ribbon synapses and have impaired hearing. Nlgn3 KO is more vulnerable to noise trauma with limited activity at high frequencies one day after noise. Furthermore, Nlgn3 KO cochleae have a 5-fold reduction in synapse number compared to wild type after two weeks of recovery. Double KO cochlear phenotypes are more prominent than the KOs, for example, 5-fold smaller synapses, 25% reduction in synapse density, and 30% less synaptic output. These observations indicate Nlgn3 and Nlgn1 are essential to cochlear ribbon synapse maturation and function.}

  abstract = {Background and Aims Despite years of research, mechanisms of pancreatic injury and healing remain poorly understood. Acute pancreatitis is a painful and debilitating condition; chronic pancreatitis may be asymptomatic, but greatly enhances the risk of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Acinar to ductal metaplasia (ADM), or the transdifferentiation of digestive enzyme producing acinar cells to ductal cells, is an early event in both conditions. While ADM is thought to function in healing and regeneration, it also represents a first step in tumorigenesis, demonstrating the duplicitous nature of this inherent plasticity. The goal of these studies was to define the populations arising in ADM, associated transcriptional changes, and their role in disease progression. Methods Acinar cells were lineage traced to follow their fate upon injury. Transcripts of more than 13,000 EYFP+ cells were determined using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Developmental trajectories were generated using several computational biology approaches that rely on non-overlapping assumptions. Data were compared to scRNA-seq studies of gastric metaplasia, oncogenic KrasG12D-induced ADM, and human pancreatitis. Results were confirmed using immunostaining and electron microscopy. Tuft and enteroendocrine cell (EEC) populations were quantified throughout tumorigenesis. KrasG12D was expressed in injury-induced ADM populations using several inducible Cre drivers. Results scRNA-seq of ADM from chronically injured pancreata revealed emergence of a mucin/ductal population that resembles gastric pyloric metaplasia. Developmental trajectories suggest that some pyloric metaplasia cells generate tuft or EEC populations as distinct lineages. Comparison to KrasG12D-induced ADM reveals populations associated with disease progression. Immunostaining demonstrates that tuft and EEC formation is an early event in tumorigenesis. Activation of KrasG12D in ADM populations results in neoplastic transformation and the formation of MUC5AC+ pit cells. Human pancreatitis samples reflect a pyloric metaplasia phenotype as well as the formation of tuft and EEC populations. Conclusions ADM under conditions of chronic injury results in the formation of a pyloric-type metaplasia which seeds disparate tuft and EEC lineages. This carefully orchestrated plasticity generates myriad epithelial cell types which likely mitigate injury, providing protection from the formation of pancreatitis and PDAC. KrasG12D expression is sufficient to drive neoplasia when targeted to injury-induced ADM populations offering an alternative origin for tumorigenesis. This program is conserved in human pancreatitis and provides insight into early events in pancreas diseases.},

  abstract = {Background & Aims
  Acinar to ductal metaplasia (ADM) occurs in the pancreas in response to tissue injury and is a potential precursor for adenocarcinoma. The goal of these studies was to define the populations arising from ADM, the associated transcriptional changes, and markers of disease progression.
  Methods
  Acinar cells were lineage-traced with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) to follow their fate post-injury. Transcripts of more than 13,000 EYFP+ cells were determined using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Developmental trajectories were generated. Data were compared with gastric metaplasia, KrasG12D-induced neoplasia, and human pancreatitis. Results were confirmed by immunostaining and electron microscopy. KrasG12D was expressed in injury-induced ADM using several inducible Cre drivers. Surgical specimens of chronic pancreatitis from 15 patients were evaluated by immunostaining.
  Results
  scRNA-seq of ADM revealed emergence of a mucin/ductal population resembling gastric pyloric metaplasia. Lineage trajectories suggest that some pyloric metaplasia cells can generate tuft and enteroendocrine cells (EECs). Comparison with KrasG12D-induced ADM identifies populations associated with disease progression. Activation of KrasG12D expression in HNF1B+ or POU2F3+ ADM populations leads to neoplastic transformation and formation of MUC5AC+ gastric-pit-like cells. Human pancreatitis samples also harbor pyloric metaplasia with a similar transcriptional phenotype.
  Conclusions
  Under conditions of chronic injury, acinar cells undergo a pyloric-type metaplasia to mucinous progenitor-like populations, which seed disparate tuft cell and EEC lineages. ADM-derived EEC subtypes are diverse. KrasG12D expression is sufficient to drive neoplasia when targeted to injury-induced ADM populations and offers an alternative origin for tumorigenesis. This program is conserved in human pancreatitis, providing insight into early events in pancreas diseases.}

	abstract = {Maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes essential subunits of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system, but is also a major damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) that engages innate immune sensors when released into the cytoplasm, outside of cells or into circulation1. This function of mtDNA contributes to antiviral resistance, but unfortunately also causes pathogenic inflammation in many disease contexts2. Cells experiencing mtDNA stress due to depletion of the mtDNA-packaging protein, Transcription Factor A, Mitochondrial (TFAM), or HSV-1 infection exhibit elongated mitochondria, mtDNA depletion, enlargement of nucleoids (mtDNA-protein complexes), and activation of cGAS/STING innate immune signaling via mtDNA released into the cytoplasm3. However, the relationships between altered mitochondrial dynamics and mtDNA-mediated activation of the cGAS-STING pathway remain unclear. Here, we show that entire enlarged nucleoids are released from mitochondria that remain bound to TFAM and colocalize with cGAS. These nucleoids arise at sites of mtDNA replication due to a block in mitochondrial fission at a stage when endoplasmic reticulum (ER) actin polymerization would normally commence, which we propose is a fission checkpoint to ensure that mtDNA has completed replication and is competent for segregation into daughter mitochondria. Released nucleoids also colocalize with the early endosomal marker RAB5 as well as the late endosomal marker RAB7 in TFAM-deficient cells and in response to mtDNA stress caused by the HSV-1 UL12.5 protein. Loss of RAB7 increases interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression. Thus, we propose that defects in mtDNA replication and/or segregation enact a late mitochondrial fission checkpoint that, if persistent, leads to selective removal of dysfunctional nucleoids by a mitochondrial-endosomal pathway. Early steps in this pathway are prone to mtDNA release and cGAS-STING activation, but the immunostimulatory mtDNA is ultimately disposed of through a mechanism involving RAB7-containing late endosomes to prevent excessive innate immune signaling. This mtDNA quality control pathway might represent a therapeutic target to prevent mtDNA-mediated inflammation and associated pathology.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Yet, there are no approved measures for preventing or treating this debilitating condition. With its slow progression, continuous and safe approaches are critical for ARHL treatment. Nicotinamide Riboside (NR), a NAD+ precursor, is well tolerated even for long-term use and is already shown effective in various disease models including Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s and Parkinson{\textquoteright}s Disease. It has also been beneficial against noise induced hearing loss and in hearing loss associated with premature aging. However, its beneficial impact on ARHL is not known. Using two different wild-type mouse strains, we show that long-term NR administration prevents the progression of ARHL. Through transcriptomic and biochemical analysis, we find that NR administration restores age-associated reduction in cochlear NAD+ levels, upregulates biological pathways associated with synaptic transmission and PPAR signaling, and reduces the number of orphan ribbon synapses between afferent auditory neurons and inner hair cells. We also find that NR targets a novel pathway of lipid droplets in the cochlea by inducing the expression of CIDEC and PLIN1 proteins that are downstream of PPAR signaling and are key for lipid droplet growth. Taken together, our results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of NR treatment for ARHL and provide novel insights into its mechanism of action.Competing Interest StatementV Bohr received Nicotinamide riboside from Chromadex Corp},

The pathogenic aggregation of misfolded prion protein (PrP) in axons underlies prion disease pathologies. The molecular mechanisms driving axonal misfolded PrP aggregate formation leading to neurotoxicity are unknown. We found that the small endolysosomal guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Arl8b recruits kinesin-1 and Vps41 (HOPS) onto endosomes carrying misfolded mutant PrP to promote their axonal entry and homotypic fusion toward aggregation inside enlarged endomembranes that we call endoggresomes. This axonal rapid endosomal sorting and transport-dependent aggregation (ARESTA) mechanism forms pathologic PrP endoggresomes that impair calcium dynamics and reduce neuronal viability. Inhibiting ARESTA diminishes endoggresome formation, rescues calcium influx, and prevents neuronal death. Our results identify ARESTA as a key pathway for the regulation of endoggresome formation and a new actionable antiaggregation target to ameliorate neuronal dysfunction in the prionopathies.}}

Here, we report the implementation of two content-aware frame interpolation (CAFI) deep learning networks, Zooming SlowMo (ZS) and Depth-Aware Video Frame Interpolation (DAIN), based on combinations of recurrent neural networks, that are highly suited for accurately predicting images in between image pairs, therefore improving the temporal resolution of image series as a post-acquisition analysis step.

We demonstrate its capabilities for single-particle tracking methods applied to the study of lysosome trafficking.

  abstract = {Understanding basic mechanisms of aging holds great promise for developing interventions that prevent or delay many age-related declines and diseases simultaneously to increase human healthspan. However, a major confounding factor in aging research is the heterogeneity of the aging process itself. At the organismal level, it is clear that chronological age does not always predict biological age or susceptibility to frailty or pathology. While genetics and environment are major factors driving variable rates of aging, additional complexity arises because different organs, tissues, and cell types are intrinsically heterogeneous and exhibit different aging trajectories normally or in response to the stresses of the aging process (e.g., damage accumulation). Tackling the heterogeneity of aging requires new and specialized tools (e.g., single-cell analyses, mass spectrometry-based approaches, and advanced imaging) to identify novel signatures of aging across scales. Cutting-edge computational approaches are then needed to integrate these disparate datasets and elucidate network interactions between known aging hallmarks. There is also a need for improved, human cell-based models of aging to ensure that basic research findings are relevant to human aging and healthspan interventions. The San Diego Nathan Shock Center (SD-NSC) provides access to cutting-edge scientific resources to facilitate the study of the heterogeneity of aging in general and to promote the use of novel human cell models of aging. The center also has a robust Research Development Core that funds pilot projects on the heterogeneity of aging and organizes innovative training activities, including workshops and a personalized mentoring program, to help investigators new to the aging field succeed. Finally, the SD-NSC participates in outreach activities to educate the general community about the importance of aging research and promote the need for basic biology of aging research in particular.},

	abstract = {Point scanning imaging systems (e.g. scanning electron or laser scanning confocal microscopes) are perhaps the most widely used tools for high resolution cellular and tissue imaging. Like all other imaging modalities, the resolution, speed, sample preservation, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of point scanning systems are difficult to optimize simultaneously. In particular, point scanning systems are uniquely constrained by an inverse relationship between imaging speed and pixel resolution. Here we show these limitations can be mitigated via the use of deep learning-based super-sampling of undersampled images acquired on a point-scanning system, which we termed point-scanning super-resolution (PSSR) imaging. Oversampled, high SNR ground truth images acquired on scanning electron or Airyscan laser scanning confocal microscopes were {\textquoteleft}crappified{\textquoteright} to generate semi-synthetic training data for PSSR models that were then used to restore real-world undersampled images. Remarkably, our EM PSSR model could restore undersampled images acquired with different optics, detectors, samples, or sample preparation methods in other labs. PSSR enabled previously unattainable 2 nm resolution images with our serial block face scanning electron microscope system. For fluorescence, we show that undersampled confocal images combined with a multiframe PSSR model trained on Airyscan timelapses facilitates Airyscan-equivalent spatial resolution and SNR with \~{}100x lower laser dose and 16x higher frame rates than corresponding high-resolution acquisitions. In conclusion, PSSR facilitates point-scanning image acquisition with otherwise unattainable resolution, speed, and sensitivity.},

  ABSTRACT={Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is a progressive, peripheral neuropathy and the most commonly inherited neurological disorder. Clinical manifestations of CMT mutations are typically limited to peripheral neurons, the longest cells in the body. Currently, mutations in at least 80 different genes are associated with CMT and new mutations are regularly being discovered. A large portion of the proteins mutated in axonal CMT have documented roles in mitochondrial mobility, suggesting that organelle trafficking defects may be a common underlying disease mechanism. This review will focus on the potential role of altered mitochondrial mobility in the pathogenesis of axonal CMT, highlighting the conceptional challenges and potential experimental and therapeutic opportunities presented by this “impaired mobility” model of the disease.}

  abstract = {The nuclear protein CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) has diverse roles in chromatin architecture and gene regulation. Functionally, CTCF associates with thousands of genomic sites and interacts with proteins, such as cohesin, or non-coding RNAs to facilitate specific transcriptional programming. In this study, we examined CTCF during the cellular stress response in human primary cells using immune-blotting, quantitative real time-PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequence (ChIP-seq) analysis, mass spectrometry, RNA immunoprecipitation-sequence analysis (RIP-seq), and Airyscan confocal microscopy. Unexpectedly, we found that CTCF is exquisitely sensitive to diverse forms of stress in normal patient-derived human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). In HMECs, a subset of CTCF protein forms complexes that localize to Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor (SC-35)-containing nuclear speckles. Upon stress, this species of CTCF protein is rapidly downregulated by changes in protein stability, resulting in loss of CTCF from SC-35 nuclear speckles and changes in CTCF-RNA interactions. Our ChIP-seq analysis indicated that CTCF binding to genomic DNA is largely unchanged. Restoration of the stress-sensitive pool of CTCF protein abundance and re-localization to nuclear speckles can be achieved by inhibition of proteasome-mediated degradation. Surprisingly, we observed the same characteristics of the stress response during neuronal differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). CTCF forms stress-sensitive complexes that localize to SC-35 nuclear speckles during a specific stage of neuronal commitment/development but not in differentiated neurons. We speculate that these particular CTCF complexes serve a role in RNA processing that may be intimately linked with specific genes in the vicinity of nuclear speckles, potentially to maintain cells in a certain differentiation state, that is dynamically regulated by environmental signals. The stress-regulated activity of CTCF is uncoupled in persistently stressed, epigenetically re-programmed “variant” HMECs and certain cancer cell lines. These results reveal new insights into CTCF function in cell differentiation and the stress-response with implications for oxidative damage-induced cancer initiation and neuro-degenerative diseases.},

  abstract = {Background & Aims
  Development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) involves acinar to ductal metaplasia and genesis of tuft cells. It has been a challenge to study these rare cells because of the lack of animal models. We investigated the role of tuft cells in pancreatic tumorigenesis.
  Methods
  We performed studies with LSL-KrasG12D/+;Ptf1aCre/+ mice (KC; develop pancreatic tumors), KC mice crossed with mice with pancreatic disruption of Pou2f3 (KPouC mice; do not develop tuft cells), or mice with pancreatic disruption of the hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase gene (Hpgds, KHC mice) and wild-type mice. Mice were allowed to age or were given caerulein to induce pancreatitis; pancreata were collected and analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, RNA sequencing, ultrastructural microscopy, and metabolic profiling. We performed laser-capture dissection and RNA-sequencing analysis of pancreatic tissues from 26 patients with pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), 19 patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), and 197 patients with PDA.
  Results
  Pancreata from KC mice had increased formation of tuft cells and higher levels of prostaglandin D2 than wild-type mice. Pancreas-specific deletion of POU2F3 in KC mice (KPouC mice) resulted in a loss of tuft cells and accelerated tumorigenesis. KPouC mice had increased fibrosis and activation of immune cells after administration of caerulein. Pancreata from KPouC and KHC mice had significantly lower levels of prostaglandin D2, compared with KC mice, and significantly increased numbers of PanINs and PDAs. KPouC and KHC mice had increased pancreatic injury after administration of caerulein, significantly less normal tissue, more extracellular matrix deposition, and higher PanIN grade than KC mice. Human PanIN and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm had gene expression signatures associated with tuft cells and increased expression of Hpgds messenger RNA compared with PDA.
  Conclusions
  In mice with KRAS-induced pancreatic tumorigenesis, loss of tuft cells accelerates tumorigenesis and increases the severity of caerulein-induced pancreatic injury, via decreased production of prostaglandin D2. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that tuft cells are a metaplasia-induced tumor attenuating cell type.}

Here we found that, phytohormone auxin-induced, sterol-dependent nanoclustering of cell surface transmembrane receptor kinase 1 (TMK1) is critical for the formation of polarized domains at the plasma membrane (PM) during the morphogenesis of cotyledon pavement cells (PC) in Arabidopsis. Auxin-induced TMK1 nanoclustering stabilizes flotillin1-associated ordered nanodomains, which in turn promote the nanoclustering of ROP6 GTPase that acts downstream of TMK1 to regulate cortical microtubule organization. In turn, cortical microtubules further stabilize TMK1- and flotillin1-containing nanoclusters at the PM. Hence, we propose a new paradigm for polarity formation: A diffusive signal triggers cell polarization by promoting cell surface receptor-mediated nanoclustering of signaling components and cytoskeleton-mediated positive feedback that reinforces these nanodomains into polarized domains.},

We analyzed suprathreshold ABR for 635 mice from 102 HMDP strains pre- and post-noise exposure (108 dB 10 kHz octave band noise exposure for 2 h) using auditory brainstem response (ABR) wave 1 suprathreshold amplitudes as part of a large survey (Myint et al., Hear Res 332:113–120, 2016). Genome-wide significance levels for pre- and post-exposure wave 1 amplitude across the HMDP were performed using FaST-LMM. Synaptic ribbon counts (Ctbp2 and mGluR2) were analyzed for the extreme strains within the HMDP. ABR wave 1 amplitude varied across all strains of the HMDP with differences ranging between 2.42 and 3.82-fold pre-exposure and between 2.43 and 7.5-fold post-exposure with several tone burst stimuli (4 kHz, 8 kHz, 12 kHz, 16 kHz, 24 kHz, and 32 kHz). Immunolabeling of paired synaptic ribbons and glutamate receptors of strains with the highest and lowest wave 1 values pre- and post-exposure revealed significant differences in functional synaptic ribbon counts.

  abstract = {Cell death can occur through different mechanisms, several of which are being explored as potential targets for cancer treatment. One form of cell death that has attracted recent interest is ferroptosis, which is triggered by high intracellular levels of lipid reactive oxygen species. Pancreatic cancer cells have high levels of reactive oxygen species but manage to avoid ferroptosis by importing extracellular cysteine. Studying mice bearing pancreatic tumors, Badgley et al. found that administration of a drug inhibiting cysteine import induced tumor-selective ferroptosis and inhibited tumor growth. Further work will be required to determine whether this therapeutic strategy will be effective in human pancreatic cancer, a tumor type for which new treatments are urgently needed. Science, this issue p. 85 A drug that lowers intracellular cysteine levels inhibits growth of pancreatic tumors in mice by inducing a specific form of cell death. Ferroptosis is a form of cell death that results from the catastrophic accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oncogenic signaling elevates lipid ROS production in many tumor types and is counteracted by metabolites that are derived from the amino acid cysteine. In this work, we show that the import of oxidized cysteine (cystine) via system xC– is a critical dependency of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which is a leading cause of cancer mortality. PDAC cells used cysteine to synthesize glutathione and coenzyme A, which, together, down-regulated ferroptosis. Studying genetically engineered mice, we found that the deletion of a system xC– subunit, Slc7a11, induced tumor-selective ferroptosis and inhibited PDAC growth. This was replicated through the administration of cyst(e)inase, a drug that depletes cysteine and cystine, demonstrating a translatable means to induce ferroptosis in PDAC.}

  ABSTRACT={Chronic pancreatitis, a known risk factor for the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), is a serious, widespread medical condition characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, and acinar to ductal metaplasia (ADM). ADM is a cell type transdifferentiation event where pancreatic acinar cells become ductal-like under conditions of injury or oncogenic mutation. Here, we show that chronic pancreatitis and ADM in genetically wild type mice results in the formation of a significant population of chemosensory tuft cells. Transcriptomic analyses of pancreatitis tuft cells identify expression of inflammatory mediators, consistent with a role for tuft cells in injury progression and/or resolution. Though similar to tuft cell populations in other organs and disease systems, we identified a number of key differences that suggest context-specific tuft cell functions. We evaluated seven different mouse strains for tuft cell formation in response to chronic injury and identified significant heterogeneity reflecting varying proclivity for epithelial plasticity between strains. These results have interesting implications in the role of epithelial plasticity and heterogeneity in pancreatitis and highlight the importance of mouse strain selection when modeling human disease.}

  abstract = {Summary This chapter explores the implications of the evolutionary history and provides the mechanisms for organelle-organelle interactions in physiology and pathophysiology. The well-characterized organelle-organelle contact in cell biology is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria junction. The vast majority of lipid synthesis enzymes are localized to the ER membrane, but several key enzymes reside within the mitochondrial outer membrane. Some phospholipid synthesis requires several key enzymes, some of which are on the ER, and others on mitochondria. Calcium influx from the ER to mitochondria appears to occur in subdomains, highlighting the existence of a highly conserved, highly organized molecular interaction that facilitates the process. Mitochondrial fission is mediated by calcium. VAPs, one of the key protein families mediating ER-autophagosome contacts and autophagosome biogenesis, mediate contacts with multiple other organelles, including the plasma membrane, mitochondria, lysosomes, and Golgi. Lipid droplets (LDs) were thought to be passive lipid-storage facilities until the discovery of multiple proteins and active functions for LDs.}

Incomplete understanding of how it arises precludes development of early detection and interception strategies to improve therapeutic outcomes. Acinar to ductal metaplasia involving genesis of tuft cells is one early step in PDA formation, but their functional significance has remained obscure due to their rarity and a lack of methods and relevant animal models for their molecular and functional analysis. Here, we show that deletion of tuft cell master regulator Pou2f3 eliminates pancreatic tuft cells and increases fibrosis, alters immune cell activation, and accelerates disease progression. We demonstrate that tuft cell expression of the prostaglandin D2 synthase Hpgds restrains pancreatic disease progression in early stages by inhibiting stromal activation. Analyses of human data sets are consistent with mouse studies. We propose that tuft cells and, by inference, the associated metaplastic lesions, play a protective role early in pancreatic tumorigenesis.Significance We find that tuft cell formation in response to oncogenic Kras is protective and restrains tumorigenesis through local production of anti-inflammatory substances, including paracrine prostaglandin D2 signaling to the stroma.

  abstract = {Cellular homeostasis relies on having dedicated and coordinated responses to a variety of stresses. The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a common stress that triggers a conserved pathway called the unfolded protein response (UPR) that mitigates damage, and dysregulation of UPR underlies several debilitating diseases. Here, we discover that a previously uncharacterized 54-amino acid microprotein PIGBOS regulates UPR. PIGBOS localizes to the mitochondrial outer membrane where it interacts with the ER protein CLCC1 at ER–mitochondria contact sites. Functional studies reveal that the loss of PIGBOS leads to heightened UPR and increased cell death. The characterization of PIGBOS reveals an undiscovered role for a mitochondrial protein, in this case a microprotein, in the regulation of UPR originating in the ER. This study demonstrates microproteins to be an unappreciated class of genes that are critical for inter-organelle communication, homeostasis, and cell survival.},

    abstract = "{Despite numerous advances in our understanding of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) genetics and biology, this disease is expected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. by 2020. These statistics largely reflect the fact that by the time PDA is detected, it has already spread, making the study of early events in tumorigenesis invaluable. Harold Dvorak is credited with suggesting that tumors behave as wounds that do not heal, specifically that they are able to induce the stroma required for their maintenance and growth. Decades of research have provided an array of molecular mechanisms supporting this hypothesis. When injured, the pancreas undergoes acinar to ductal metaplasia (ADM) where digestive enzyme-producing acinar cells transdifferentiate to ductal cells; a process thought to allow for tissue healing and repair. Though a number of insightful studies have been conducted to determine the underlying mechanisms of this process, it is still incompletely understood. Using a number of high-resolution imaging techniques and lineage tracing models, we have found that chronic pancreatic injury is sufficient to induce formation of a number of differentiated cell types during ADM, including tuft cells, which are absent from the normal pancreas and may function in tissue repair.Tuft cells are solitary chemosensory cells found throughout the hollow organs of the respiratory and digestive tracts. Their expression of taste, neuronal, and inflammatory cell signaling factors is thought to enable monitoring of intraluminal homeostasis and local response via effectors. Previous studies demonstrate that, in mice, tuft cells are absent from the normal pancreas, but transdifferentiate from the acinar cell epithelium in response to oncogenic Kras expression. Interestingly, while they increase during the genesis of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), they are not detected in PDA. Tuft cell formation is also characteristic of human pancreatitis and PanIN. These data suggest a conserved, transient, but currently undefined role for tuft cells in early tumorigenesis. Here, we employ novel mouse models to elucidate this role and to identify consequences of tuft cell ablation. These studies suggest that an important function of tuft cells involves production of immune-modulatory factors in response to injury and oncogenesis. Consistent with this, we show that pancreas-specific Pou2f3 ablation eliminates tuft cell formation and enhances disease progression. Collectively, these data suggest that neoplastic lesions that form in response to oncogenic mutation evoke the cellular heterogeneity that occurs during ADM in response to tissue injury. We conclude that tuft cells and, by inference, the associated metaplastic and neoplastic lesions, play a protective role early in pancreatic injury and tumorigenesis.Citation Format: Kathleen E.

Obesity compromises function of muscle, which accounts for a majority of body mass. Behavioral intervention that can counteract obesity arising from genetic, diet or circadian disruption and can improve muscle function holds untapped potential to combat the obesity epidemic. Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) subject to obesogenic challenges exhibits metabolic disease phenotypes in skeletal muscle; sarcomere disorganization, mitochondrial deformation, upregulation of Phospho-AKT level, aberrant intramuscular lipid infiltration, and insulin resistance. Imposing time-restricted feeding (TRF) paradigm in which flies were fed for 12 h during the day counteracts obesity-induced dysmetabolism and improves muscle performance by suppressing intramuscular fat deposits, Phospho-AKT level, mitochondrial aberrations, and markers of insulin resistance. Importantly, TRF was effective even in an irregular lighting schedule mimicking shiftwork. Hence, TRF is an effective dietary intervention for combating metabolic dysfunction arising from multiple causes.},

It is known that the cytoskeleton and molecular motors are directly involved in regulating mitochondrial morphology. Here we show that myosin-Va, an actin-based molecular motor, is required for the malignant properties of melanoma cells and localizes to mitochondria in these cells. Knockdown of myosin-Va increases cellular respiration rates and ROS production and decreases glucose uptake and lactate secretion. In addition, knockdown of myosin-Va results in reduced mitochondrial fission and correspondingly elongated mitochondria. We show that myosin-Va interacts with the mitochondrial outer membrane protein Spire1C, an actin-regulatory protein implicated in mitochondrial fission, and that Spire1C recruits myosin-Va to mitochondria. Finally, we show that during mitochondrial fission myosin-Va localization to mitochondria increases, and that myosin-Va localizes to mitochondrial fission sites immediately adjacent to Drp1 punctae. We conclude that myosin-Va facilitates mitochondrial fission. These data implicate myosin-Va as a target for the Warburg effect in melanoma cells.},

  abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a dismal prognosis largely owing to inefficient diagnosis and tenacious drug resistance. Activation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) and consequent development of dense stroma are prominent features accounting for this aggressive biology1,2. The reciprocal interplay between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) not only enhances tumour progression and metastasis but also sustains their own activation, facilitating a vicious cycle to exacerbate tumorigenesis and drug resistance3–7. Furthermore, PSC activation occurs very early during PDAC tumorigenesis8–10, and activated PSCs comprise a substantial fraction of the tumour mass, providing a rich source of readily detectable factors. Therefore, we hypothesized that the communication between PSCs and PCCs could be an exploitable target to develop effective strategies for PDAC therapy and diagnosis. Here, starting with a systematic proteomic investigation of secreted disease mediators and underlying molecular mechanisms, we reveal that leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a key paracrine factor from activated PSCs acting on cancer cells. Both pharmacologic LIF blockade and genetic Lifr deletion markedly slow tumour progression and augment the efficacy of chemotherapy to prolong survival of PDAC mouse models, mainly by modulating cancer cell differentiation and epithelial–mesenchymal transition status. Moreover, in both mouse models and human PDAC, aberrant production of LIF in the pancreas is restricted to pathological conditions and correlates with PDAC pathogenesis, and changes in the levels of circulating LIF correlate well with tumour response to therapy. Collectively, these findings reveal a function of LIF in PDAC tumorigenesis, and suggest its translational potential as an attractive therapeutic target and circulating marker. Our studies underscore how a better understanding of cell–cell communication within the tumour microenvironment can suggest novel strategies for cancer therapy.},

  abstract = { Intracellular organelles constantly undergo fission to facilitate turnover, transport, and functional changes. The cytoskeleton has long been understood to play a role in these events, and recent work strongly suggests that several conserved molecular players cooperate with the cytoskeleton to mediate the fission process. Membrane curvature-inducing, membrane scission proteins, and force-inducing cytoskeletal proteins all cooperate to drive the fission process. Recent work suggests that the endoplasmic reticulum serves as the linchpin that orchestrates and spatially organizes fission via these curvature-inducing, scission, and force-producing molecules. This all leads us to postulate a “universal theory” of organelle fission with distinct biophysical and biochemical features mediated by a finite number of physical and molecular constraints. This new physical paradigm deserves special attention from those who wish to model these processes, because previous theoretical and experimental attempts to elucidate these fission mechanisms have not included the organizing factor of the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we review the basic concepts of this new model for organelle fission, and explore the implications thereof. Previous studies that did not include this component can now be interpreted in light of these new data and serve as a useful guide for understanding how this process happens in vivo. Thus, this review provides direction for future modeling and experimental efforts to better understand how these complex systems and processes are regulated in both healthy and diseased biological systems. }

We present evidence that, in hippocampal neurons, activation of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway affects multiple aspects of mitochondria. Mitochondrial mass was increased significantly in neurons treated with Shh. Using biochemical and fluorescence imaging analyses, we show that Shh signaling activity reduces mitochondrial fission and promotes mitochondrial elongation, at least in part, via suppression of the mitochondrial fission protein dynamin-like GTPase Drp1. Mitochondria from Shh-treated neurons were more electron-dense, as revealed by electron microscopy, and had higher membrane potential and respiratory activity. We further show that Shh protects neurons against a variety of stresses, including the mitochondrial poison rotenone, amyloid β-peptide, hydrogen peroxide, and high levels of glutamate. Collectively our data suggest a link between Shh pathway activity and the physiological properties of mitochondria in hippocampal neurons. }

TM molecules self-assemble in the endolymph fluid environment, interacting medially with the spiral limbus and distally with the outer hair cell stereocilia. Here, we used immunogold labeling in freeze-substituted mouse cochleae to assess the fine localization of both tectorins in distinct TM regions. We observed that the TM adheres to the spiral limbus through a dense thin matrix enriched in α- and β-tectorin, both likely bound to the membranes of interdental cells. Freeze-etching images revealed that type II collagen fibrils were crosslinked by short thin filaments (4±1.5nm, width), resembling another collagen type protein, or chains of globular elements (15±3.2nm, diameter). Gold-particles for both tectorins also localized adjacent to the type II collagen fibrils, suggesting that these globules might be composed essentially of α- and β-tectorins. Finally, the presence of gold-particles at the TM lower side suggests that the outer hair cell stereocilia membrane has a molecular partner to tectorins, probably stereocilin, allowing the physical connection between the TM and the organ of Corti.}

  How resident stem cells and their immediate progenitors rebuild tissues of pre-injury organization and size for proportional regeneration is not well understood. Using 3D, time-lapse intravital imaging for direct visualization of the muscle regeneration process in live mice, we report that extracellular matrix remnants from injured skeletal muscle fibers, “ghost fibers,” govern muscle stem/progenitor cell behaviors during proportional regeneration. Stem cells were immobile and quiescent without injury whereas their activated progenitors migrated and divided after injury. Unexpectedly, divisions and migration were primarily bi-directionally oriented along the ghost fiber longitudinal axis, allowing for spreading of progenitors throughout ghost fibers. Re-orienting ghost fibers impacted myogenic progenitors’ migratory paths and division planes, causing disorganization of regenerated muscle fibers. We conclude that ghost fibers are autonomous, architectural units necessary for proportional regeneration after tissue injury. This finding reinforces the need to fabricate bioengineered matrices that mimic living tissue matrices for tissue regeneration therapy.}

The force for constriction is thought to involve actin polymerization by the ER-anchored isoform of the formin protein inverted formin 2 (INF2). Unknown is the mechanism triggering INF2-mediated actin polymerization at ER-mitochondria intersections. We show that a novel isoform of the formin-binding, actin-nucleating protein Spire, Spire1C, localizes to mitochondria and directly links mitochondria to the actin cytoskeleton and the ER. Spire1C binds INF2 and promotes actin assembly on mitochondrial surfaces. Disrupting either Spire1C actin- or formin-binding activities reduces mitochondrial constriction and division. We propose Spire1C cooperates with INF2 to regulate actin assembly at ER-mitochondrial contacts. Simulations support this model's feasibility and demonstrate polymerizing actin filaments can induce mitochondrial constriction. Thus, Spire1C is optimally positioned to serve as a molecular hub that links mitochondria to actin and the ER for regulation of mitochondrial division.},

Consistent with its specialized role, the staircase geometry (SCG) of hair cell bundles presents one of the most striking, intricate, and precise organizations of actin-based cellular shapes. Composed of rows of actin-filled stereocilia with increasing lengths, the hair cell’s staircase-shaped bundle is formed from a progenitor field of smaller, thinner, and uniformly spaced microvilli with relatively invariant lengths. While recent genetic studies have provided a significant increase in information on the multitude of stereocilia protein components, there is currently no model that integrates the basic physical forces and biochemical processes necessary to explain the emergence of the SCG. We propose such a model derived from the biophysical and biochemical characteristics of actin-based protrusions. We demonstrate that polarization of the cell’s apical surface, due to the lateral polarization of the entire epithelial layer, plays a key role in promoting SCG formation. Furthermore, our model explains many distinct features of the manifestations of SCG in different species and in the presence of various deafness-associated mutations.},

  abstract = {Class III myosins are unique members of the myosin superfamily in that they contain both a motor and kinase domain. We have found that motor activity is decreased by autophosphorylation, although little is known about the regulation of the kinase domain. We demonstrate by mass spectrometry that Thr-178 and Thr-184 in the kinase domain activation loop and two threonines in the loop 2 region of the motor domain are autophosphorylated (Thr-908 and Thr-919). The kinase activity of MYO3A 2IQ with the phosphomimic (T184E) or phosphoblock (T184A) mutations demonstrates that kinase activity is reduced 30-fold as a result of the T184A mutation, although the Thr-178 site only had a minor impact on kinase activity. Interestingly, the actin-activated ATPase activity of MYO3A 2IQ is slightly reduced as a result of the T178A and T184A mutations suggesting coupling between motor and kinase domains. Full-length GFP-tagged T184A and T184E MYO3A constructs transfected into COS7 cells do not disrupt the ability of MYO3A to localize to filopodia structures. In addition, we demonstrate that T184E MYO3A reduces filopodia elongation in the presence of espin-1, whereas T184A enhances filopodia elongation in a similar fashion to kinase-dead MYO3A. Our results suggest that as MYO3A accumulates at the tips of actin protrusions, autophosphorylation of Thr-184 enhances kinase activity resulting in phosphorylation of the MYO3A motor and reducing motor activity. The differential regulation of the kinase and motor activities allows for MYO3A to precisely self-regulate its concentration in the actin bundle-based structures of cells.},

  abstract = {Mechanotransduction in the mammalian auditory system depends on mechanosensitive channels in the hair bundles that project from the apical surface of the sensory hair cells. Individual stereocilia within each bundle contain a core of tightly packed actin filaments, whose length is dynamically regulated during development and in the adult. We show that the actin-binding protein epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8 (Eps8)L2, a member of the Eps8-like protein family, is a newly identified hair bundle protein that is localized at the tips of stereocilia of both cochlear and vestibular hair cells. It has a spatiotemporal expression pattern that complements that of Eps8. In the cochlea, whereas Eps8 is essential for the initial elongation of stereocilia, Eps8L2 is required for their maintenance in adult hair cells. In the absence of both proteins, the ordered staircase structure of the hair bundle in the cochlea decays. In contrast to the early profound hearing loss associated with an absence of Eps8, Eps8L2 null-mutant mice exhibit a late-onset, progressive hearing loss that is directly linked to a gradual deterioration in hair bundle morphology. We conclude that Eps8L2 is required for the long-term maintenance of the staircase structure and mechanosensory function of auditory hair bundles. It complements the developmental role of Eps8 and is a candidate gene for progressive age-related hearing loss.}}

A flurry of recent papers has reported multiple myosin motor proteins involved in regulating stereocilia structures by transporting actin-regulatory cargo to the tips of stereocilia.1-13 In our recent paper, we show that two paralogous class 3 myosins — Myo3a and Myo3b — both transport the actin-regulatory protein Espin 1 (Esp1) to stereocilia and filopodia tips in a remarkably similar, albeit non-identical fashion.1 Here we present experimental and computational data that suggests that subtle differences between these two proteins’ biophysical and biochemical properties can help us understand how these myosin species target and regulate the lengths of actin protrusions. }

  abstract = {Myosin IIIA (MYO3A) targets actin protrusion tips using a motility mechanism dependent on both motor and tail actin-binding activity [1]. We show that myosin IIIB (MYO3B) lacks tail actin-binding activity and is unable to target COS7 cell filopodia tips, yet is somehow able to target stereocilia tips. Strikingly, when MYO3B is coexpressed with espin-1 (ESPN1), a MYO3A cargo protein endogenously expressed in stereocilia [2], MYO3B targets and carries ESPN1 to COS7 filopodia tips. We show that this tip-localization is lost when we remove the ESPN1 C-terminus actin-binding site. We also demonstrate that, like MYO3A [2], MYO3B can elongate filopodia by transporting ESPN1 to the polymerizing end of actin filaments. The mutual dependence of MYO3B and ESPN1 for tip-localization reveals a novel mechanism for the cell to regulate myosin tip-localization via a reciprocal relationship with cargo that directly participates in actin binding for motility. Our results are consistent with a novel form of motility for class III myosins that requires both motor and tail domain actin-binding activity, and show that the actin-binding tail can be replaced by actin-binding cargo. This study also provides a framework to better understand the late-onset hearing loss phenotype in patients with MYO3A mutations. Go to:},

  abstract = {Myosin XVa (MyoXVa) and its cargo whirlin are implicated in deafness and vestibular dysfunction and have been shown to localize at stereocilia tips and to be essential for the elongation of these actin protrusions [1?4]. Given that whirlin has no known actin-regulatory activity, it remains unclear how these proteins work together to influence stereocilia length. Here we show that the actin-regulatory protein Eps8 [5] interacts with MyoXVa and that mice lacking Eps8 show short stereocilia compared to MyoXVa- and whirlin-deficient mice. We show that Eps8 fails to accumulate at the tips of stereocilia in the absence of MyoXVa, that overexpression of MyoXVa results in both elongation of stereocilia and increased accumulation of Eps8 at stereocilia tips, and that the exogenous expression of MyoXVa in MyoXVa-deficient hair cells rescues Eps8 tip localization. We find that Eps8 also interacts with whirlin and that the expression of both Eps8 and MyoXVa at stereocilia tips is reduced in whirlin-deficient mice. We conclude that MyoXVa, whirlin, and Eps8 are integral components of the stereocilia tip complex, where Eps8 is a central actin-regulatory element for elongation of the stereocilia actin core.},

  abstract = {Myosin IIIa (Myo3A) transports cargo to the distal end of actin protrusions and contains a kinase domain that is thought to autoregulate its activity. Because Myo3A tends to cluster at the tips of actin protrusions, we investigated whether intermolecular phosphorylation could regulate Myo3A biochemical activity, cellular localization, and cellular function. Inactivation of Myo3A 2IQ kinase domain with the point mutation K50R did not alter maximal ATPase activity, whereas phosphorylation of Myo3A 2IQ resulted in reduced maximal ATPase activity and actin affinity. The rate and degree of Myo3A 2IQ autophosphorylation was unchanged by the presence of actin but was found to be dependent upon Myo3A 2IQ concentration within the range of 0.1 to 1.2 ?m, indicating intermolecular autophosphorylation. In cultured cells, we observed that the filopodial tip localization of Myo3A lacking the kinase domain decreased when co-expressed with kinase-active, full-length Myo3A. The cellular consequence of reduced Myo3A tip localization was decreased filopodial density along the cell periphery, identifying a novel cellular function for Myo3A in mediating the formation and stability of actin-based protrusions. Our results suggest that Myo3A motor activity is regulated through a mechanism involving concentration-dependent autophosphorylation. We suggest that this regulatory mechanism plays an essential role in mediating the transport and actin bundle formation/stability functions of Myo3A.},

  abstract = {We present a physical model that describes the active localization of actin-regulating proteins inside stereocilia during steady-state conditions. The mechanism of localization is through the interplay of free diffusion and directed motion, which is driven by coupling to the treadmilling actin filaments and to myosin motors that move along the actin filaments. The resulting localization of both the molecular motors and their cargo is calculated, and is found to have an exponential (or steeper) profile. This localization can be at the base (driven by actin retrograde flow and minus-end myosin motors), or at the stereocilia tip (driven by plus-end myosin motors). The localization of proteins that influence the actin depolymerization and polymerization rates allow us to describe the narrow shape of the stereocilia base, and the observed increase of the actin polymerization rate with the stereocilia height.},

  abstract = {Net rates of biogeochemical reactions in subseafloor sediments can be quantified from concentration profiles of dissolved reactants or products and physical properties of the sediment. To study net rates of microbial activities in deep sediments, we developed a robust approach that is well suited to use over a broad range of sediment depths. Our approach is based on a finite-difference solution to a continuity equation that considers molecular diffusion, sediment burial, fluid advection, and reaction under the assumption of steady state. Numerical procedures are adopted to identify the maximum number of depth intervals with statistically different reaction rates. The approach explicitly considers downcore variation in physical properties and sample spacing. Uncertainties in the rate estimates are quantified using a Monte Carlo technique. We tested our approach using synthetic concentration profiles generated from analytical solutions to the continuity equation. We then applied the approach to concentration profiles of dissolved sulfate, sulfide, methane, and manganese in the 420-m thick sediment column of eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean Drilling Program Site 1226. Our results indicate that (i) sulfate reduction and iron reduction occur at most sediment depths, (ii) net methane production occurs in discrete depth intervals and (iii) manganese reduction occurs near the seafloor and deep in the sediments. These results provide quantitative evidence that multiple respiration pathways co-exist in the same depth intervals of these deep subseafloor sediments.}

@article{Manor2004,
  abstract = {A robust numerical procedure for biogeochemical interpretation and analysis of measured concentration profiles has been developed by Berg et al. 1 The model utilizes an approximation of Fick's Second Law to find constant reaction rates in equally spaced/sized ranges of depth (aka ‘zones'). This method works well for profiles several centimeters deep, where the resolution and complexity of behavior is uniform throughout the profile. However, it is limiting when attempting to analyze profiles several hundred meters in depth, in which case a model that can adjust accordingly to changes in sampling resolution and profile complexity would be more useful/accurate. Therefore, the concepts of the old model have been used and modified to make a new model that allows differently spaced and sized zones throughout the profile. It is evident that this approach is flexible enough to handle the complexity of profiles in marine sediments several hundred meters below the ocean floor. The program was written in MATLAB, which enables the user to analyze the profiles with a higher degree of accuracy in a fraction of the time (several hours vs. several minutes), due to MATLAB's matrix calculating abilities, providing a new useful tool for analyzing concentration profiles.},
